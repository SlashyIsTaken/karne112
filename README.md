ESX | Simple Dutch 112 Emergency functions 

# Overview
Well, hello there. This is a very simple script that I wrote up in a day, and thought it may come in useful for some of you guys.

# Functions
- /112 <service> <message> | Dial an emergency service. Preconfigured services are; 'anwb' (mechanic), 'ambulance', and 'politie' (police). Once executed, all current players who have the job 'service' will receive an emergency message, with the option to set a waypoint to the user. <br>
- F9 | This police function will broadcast the invoking officer's location to all available units. Button is configurable somewhere in client.lua. <br>
- F11 | Panic Button. This function will broadcast the invoking officer's location to all available units, mentioning the officer is in exceptional need for help. Again, button is configurable. <br>
